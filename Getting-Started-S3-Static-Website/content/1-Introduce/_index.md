Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides a simple and cost-effective way to host static websites. S3 static website hosting allows you to serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static content directly from an S3 bucket without the need for web servers or complex infrastructure.

With Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting, users can:

- Host static websites with high availability and scalability.
- Serve content globally with low latency using CloudFront integration.
- Configure custom domain names using Route53.
- Set up custom error pages and redirects.
- Benefit from S3's durability and security features.
- Pay only for the storage and bandwidth you use.

This workshop focuses on practical scenarios including creating S3 buckets, configuring static website hosting, testing websites, and optionally setting up custom domains to demonstrate how S3 provides a simple and cost-effective solution for hosting static websites.
