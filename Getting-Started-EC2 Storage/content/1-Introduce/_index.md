Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers by allowing them to launch and manage virtual servers, known as instances, on demand.

With Amazon EC2, users can:

- Launch instances with various operating systems and configurations.
- Scale computing resources up or down based on workload requirements.
- Configure security and networking settings using tools like Security Groups and Key Pairs.
- Choose from a wide range of instance types optimized for compute, memory, storage, or GPU.
- Integrate with other AWS services such as Amazon VPC, AWS IAM, and Amazon S3.

With the above advantages, Amazon EC2 can be deployed within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture using components such as Internet Gateway, Public Subnet, Security Group, and Route Tables, allowing users to securely access and manage their instances while optimizing both cost and performance.
