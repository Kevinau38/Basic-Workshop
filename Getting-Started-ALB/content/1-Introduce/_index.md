Amazon EC2 Storage provides persistent, high-performance block storage for Amazon EC2 instances through Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). EBS volumes can be attached to EC2 instances and provide the persistent storage needed for file systems, databases, and any other use cases that require persistent storage.

With Amazon EC2 Storage, users can:

- Create EBS volumes with different volume types optimized for performance or cost.
- Take point-in-time snapshots of EBS volumes for backup and disaster recovery.
- Create Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to capture the entire instance configuration.
- Restore EC2 instances from AMI to quickly deploy identical configurations.
- Encrypt EBS volumes and snapshots for enhanced security.
- Resize volumes and change volume types as needed.

This workshop focuses on practical storage management scenarios including creating snapshots, building AMIs, and restoring instances to demonstrate how EC2 storage solutions provide data persistence and recovery capabilities for cloud workloads.
