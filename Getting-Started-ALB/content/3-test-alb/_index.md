In this step, we will test our Application Load Balancer to verify that it's properly distributing traffic between our two EC2 instances.

## Check ALB

1. Go to **EC2 Console** â†’ **Load Balancers**

2. Select your load balancer `d-alb-web-alb`

3. Copy the **DNS name** from the Details section

## Access from Browser

1. Open your web browser

2. Paste the DNS name into the address bar

3. You should see a page displaying "Hello World from" followed by the hostname of one of your EC2 instances

## Test Load Balancing

1. Reload the page several times (press F5 or Ctrl+R)

2. You should notice that the hostname changes between your two instances:
   - Sometimes showing `d-ec2-web-server-01`
   - Sometimes showing `d-ec2-web-server-02`

3. This demonstrates that the Application Load Balancer is successfully distributing traffic across both instances

Now that we have successfully tested our Application Load Balancer and verified that it's distributing traffic properly, let's proceed to clean up the resources we created.
